## Python Basics – Practice Exercises (Google Colab Project)

This repo is a curated collection of beginner-friendly Python exercises completed in Google Colab.
The goal was simple: build a strong foundation in Python’s core data structures and logic flows while keeping the workflow clean, modular, and testable.

This exercise pack covers the fundamentals every engineer needs in their toolbox — lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, conditionals, and loops. Each section breaks down a specific concept using practical examples that mimic real-world logic and everyday tasks.

The work was structured to emphasize clarity, accuracy, and hands-on problem-solving. Every snippet reinforces how Python thinks, how data moves, and how control flows. Pure muscle-building for the brain.

## What’s Inside

Section 1 — Lists

Operations like creating lists, adding and removing elements, indexing, sorting, combining lists, and checking for values.

Section 2 — Tuples

Tuple creation, indexing, immutability, and converting tuples to lists.

Section 3 — Dictionaries

Creating dictionaries, updating values, adding keys, deleting keys, looping through keys/values, using .items(), membership tests, and nested dictionaries.

Section 4 — Sets

Creating sets, adding/removing elements, performing set operations, and proving how sets remove duplicates automatically.

Section 5 — Conditionals

User input, age checks, password validation, even/odd checks, temperature logic, and grading logic using if / elif / else.

Section 6 — Loops

For-loops, while-loops, iterating through lists and dictionaries, and computing a sum using iteration.


## Why This Project Matters

This collection is basically the onboarding deck for anyone stepping into Python.
It forces repetition, builds intuition, and aligns thinking with Pythonic standards.
It’s foundational, but not boring  every exercise hits a core concept you’ll need in real codebases, interviews, and data workflows.


## Environment

All exercises were written and executed in Google Colab, leveraging its clean notebook workflow for quick testing, iteration, and debugging.

Next Steps

This project will keep expanding with slightly more advanced tasks: functions, list comprehensions, file handling, error handling, and eventually object-oriented programming.

The foundation is set. Now we build.
